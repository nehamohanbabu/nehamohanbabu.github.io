## My data

I try to make all my data open access. But, I do have some additional data that I am still in the process of analyzing, but I will be more than happy to collaborate and/or contribute those data to regional and global projects

### Available datasets

-   Species composition in 1 x 1 m plots from 60 plots across the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania

-   Leaf traits of dominant herbaceous species from the Serengeti National Park

-   Leaf and defense traits of Solanum incanum in the Serengeti National Park

-   Species composition and leaf traits from grazed and ungrazed plots in a long-term grazing exclosure experiment in the Serengeti National Park

## Network science

I am co-leading an effort to establish a network of forest ecologists in India to promote collaborative research.

You can read more about the network on the [INvenTree website](https://india-inventree.github.io/)
