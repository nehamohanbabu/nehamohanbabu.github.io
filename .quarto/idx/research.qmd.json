To address this, we leveraged data from one such long-term experiment, BioCON, which manipulates diversity, CO2 and N levels to examine a) the influence of species interactions on the differential responses of herbaceous functional groups to GCDs over a 25 year period; b) the long term impact of N and CO2 enrichment on plant diversity; and c) the consequences of multi-decadal exposure to elevated N and CO2 on diversity-ecosystem function relationships\n\n![Aerial view of the BioCON experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA](biocon.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"430\"}\n\n### Intraspecific variation in plant defense traits\n\nWithin species variation in defense traits is poorly characterized for plants adapted to intense large mammal herbivory, especially in the context of multiple resource gradients.
