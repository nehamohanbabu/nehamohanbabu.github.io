I try to make all my data open access. But, I do have some additional data that I am still in the process of analyzing, but I will be more than happy to collaborate and/or contribute those data to regional and global projects

Available datasets
===
* Species composition in 1 x 1 m plots from 60 plots across the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania
* Leaf traits of dominant herbaceous species from the Serengeti National Park
* Leaf and defense traits of Solanum incanum in the Serengeti National Park
* Species composition and leaf traits from grazed and ungrazed plots in a long-term grazing exclosure experiment in the Serengeti National Park
