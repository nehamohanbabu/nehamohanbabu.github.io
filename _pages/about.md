About me 
======
I am a postdoctoral associate at University of Minnesota, working in the Reich, Hobbie and Isbell labs on the BioCON experiment. I am fascinated by the different interactions that plants engage in, influence of resources on these interactions, and the combined impact they have on plant community and diversity.

For my graduate work in Ritchie lab at Syracuse University, I studied the impact of multiple resource limitation on plant-herbivore interactions using both theoretical and empirical approaches.
